    "helpTitleWhatIsPDFkit": "What is PDFkit?",
    "helpParagraphWhatIsPDFkit": "PDFkit is a desktop application that allows you to perform editing operations on PDF files in a simple, fast, and secure way. Unlike web services, PDFkit does not require uploading documents to external servers: most operations are performed locally on your device, ensuring greater speed, privacy, and data control.",
    "helpTitleMerge": "How does the Merge operation work?",
    "helpParagraphMerge": "The Merge operation allows you to combine up to 10 PDF files into a single document. Simply select the PDFs you want to merge, in the exact order they should appear in the final file. After selecting the files, assign a custom name to the merged document, which will then be saved as a single file once the operation is started.",
    "helpTitleSplit": "How does the Split operation work?",
    "helpParagraphSplit": "The Split function allows you to divide a PDF file into multiple parts, according to your preferences. Two types of splitting are available: With Custom Intervals, you can specify exactly which pages to extract into separate groups using flexible syntax (e.g., 1-3,5,8-10). This way, you can create documents that contain only the sections of interest. The Fixed Interval mode splits the PDF into blocks of N pages. For example, by setting 5, the document will be divided into sections of 5 pages each (e.g., pages 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, etc.). Once started, the application automatically generates the new blocks.",
    "helpTitleRemove": "How does the Remove operation work?",
    "helpParagraphRemove": "The Remove operation allows you to quickly and directly delete specific pages from a PDF file. This feature is useful when you want to remove unnecessary content, empty sections, or information to be excluded before sharing or archiving the document. You can select a single PDF file and specify the pages to delete using custom intervals with flexible syntax (e.g., 1-3,5,8-10). Once the operation is started, the application automatically generates a new version of the document without the indicated pages.",
    "helpTitleExtract": "How does the Extract operation work?",
    "helpParagraphExtract": "The Extract operation allows you to export specific pages from a PDF file and save them as a new document. It is especially useful when you want to isolate relevant sections of a PDF without modifying the original file. You can select only one PDF at a time and specify the pages to extract using custom intervals with flexible syntax (e.g., 1-3,5,8-10). Once the operation is started, the application automatically generates the new documents.",
    "helpTitleWatermark": "How does the Watermark operation work?",
    "helpParagraphWatermark": "The Watermark operation allows you to add text overlaid on all pages of a PDF, useful for indicating that a document is confidential, a draft, a facsimile, or for other visual marking needs. You can customize several parameters of the watermark: Text (e.g., “FACSIMILE”), Opacity (to adjust transparency), Rotation (in degrees, e.g., 45°), Position (center, corners, top or bottom), and Size (small, medium, large). Once started, the application automatically generates the new version of the document.",
    "helpTitleSummarize": "How does the Summarize operation work?",
    "helpParagraphSummarize": "The Summarize operation automatically generates a summary of the contents of a PDF document, reducing the text to a few lines highlighting the main information. It is the only operation in the application that requires uploading to an external server, as it uses an AI service to process the text. For this reason, it may involve a short waiting time and has a limited number of uses. At the end of the process, a new PDF containing the summary is generated.",
